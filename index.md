# About Me
I am currently a joint master student studying at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Norway), Université Jean Monnet (France), and University of Eastern Finland (Finland).   
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Northeastern University (China). During my bachelor studies, I was an exchange or visiting student at Harbin Institute of Technology (China), Okayama University (Japan), Technische Universität Dortmund (Germany), and ShanghaiTech University (China).

# Experience
*  Internship: Overcoming Class Imbalance in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy by 3D Simulation   
06/2022 – 08/2022, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany  
Based on the work of VR-Caps in Unity, we created our own models of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from which a large number of simulated images were generated.  
Based on MobileNet and transfer learning techniques, we build a convolutional neural network to train a binary classifier.  
The experiments prove that the 3D simulation pipeline provides a potential useful solution for classification tasks and class imbalance.  

*  Internship: Big Data Analysis   
06/2020 – 07/2020, Neusoft Technology Co., Ltd., Shenyang, China  
Lead one team (5 people) to design and implement an Airline Company Customer Value Analysis System based on big data analysis techniques
